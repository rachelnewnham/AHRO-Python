Patients receiving biologic therapies have an improved quality of life, facilitating travel to exotic destinations and potentially placing them at risk of a range of infections. For each biologic agent, we review associated travel-related infection risk and expected travel vaccine response and effectiveness. Method(s): A PUBMED search [vaccination OR vaccine] AND/OR ['specific vaccine'] AND/OR [immunology OR immune response OR response] AND [biologic OR biological OR biologic agent] was performed. A review of the literature was performed in order to develop recommendations on vaccination for patients in receipt of biologic therapy travelling to high-risk travel destinations. Result(s): There is a paucity of literature in this area, however, it is apparent that travel-related infection risk is increased in patients on biologic therapy and when illness occurs they are at a higher risk of complication and hospitalization. Patients in receipt of biologic agents are deemed as having a high level of immunosuppression-live vaccines, including the yellow fever vaccine, are contraindicated. Inactivated vaccines are considered safe; however, vaccine response can be attenuated by the patient's biologic therapy, thereby resulting in reduced vaccine effectiveness and protection. Conclusion(s): Best practice requires a collaborative approach between the patient's primary healthcare physician, relevant specialist and travel medicine expert, who should all be familiar with the immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory effects resulting from the biologic therapies. Timing of vaccines should be carefully planned, and if possible, vaccination provided well before established immunosuppression.Copyright © International Society of Travel Medicine, 2018.

Victoria","Purpose: This study aimed to explore pharmacists' and physicians' perceptions of use, barriers to use and the healthcare outcomes associated with use of Australia's national personally controlled electronic health record-known as My Health Record-in the emergency department. Method(s): A mixed methods approach was deployed, including surveys and individual semi-structured interviews. All physicians and pharmacists who work in the emergency department at Cabrini Health (a non-for-profit healthcare provider in Victoria, Australia) were invited to participate. Due to the timing of elective blocks, physician trainees were excluded from interviews. Result(s): A total of 40 emergency medicine clinicians responded to the survey. Over 50% (n = 22) of all respondents had used My Health Record in the emergency department at least once. A total of 18 clinicians participated in the semi-structured interviews, which led to the identification of three themes with multiple sub-themes regarding My Health Record: (1) benefits; (2) effectiveness; and; (3) barriers. Conclusion(s): Participants reported My Health Record use in the emergency department delivers efficiencies for clinicians and has a heightened utility for complex patients, consistent with previous research conducted outside of the Australian setting. Barriers to use were revealed: outdated content, a lack of trust, a low perception of value, no patient record and multiple medical record systems. The participants in this study highlighted that training and awareness raising is needed in order to improve My Health Record use in the emergency department, a need stressed by physician's. Further observational research is required to explores meaningful MHR use at scale.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Click here for full text options,"Mullins, Alexandra K.; ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0285-9156"

Background(s): Natalizumab is highly effective for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), but its use is complicated by opportunistic JCV infection. This virus can result in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Serial assessment of JCV serostatus is mandated during natalizumab treatment. Method(s): Patients treated with natalizumab for RRMS at six tertiary hospitals in Melbourne, Australia (n = 865) and 11 MS treatment centres in Brazil (n = 136) were assessed for change in JCV serostatus, duration of exposure to natalizumab and prior immunosuppression. Sensitivity analyses examined whether sex, age, tertiary centre, prior immunosuppression or number of JCV tests affected time to seroconversion. Result(s): From a cohort of 1001 natalizumab-treated patients, durable positive seroconversion was observed in 83 of 345 initially JCV negative patients (24.1%; 7.3% per year). Conversely, 16 of 165 initially JCV positive patients experienced durable negative seroconversion (9.7%; 3.8% per year). Forty patients (3.9%) had fluctuating serostatus. Time-to-event analysis did not identify a relationship between JCV seroconversion and duration of natalizumab exposure. Prior exposure to immunosuppression was not associated with an increased hazard of positive JCV seroconversion. Male sex was associated with increased JCV seroconversion risk [adjusted hazard ratio 2.09 (95% confidence interval 1.17-3.71) p = 0.012]. Conclusion(s): In this large international cohort of natalizumab-treated patients we observed an annual durable positive seroconversion rate of 7.3%. This rate exceeds that noted in registration and post-marketing studies for natalizumab. This rate also greatly exceeds that predicted by epidemiological studies of JCV seroconversion in healthy populations. Taken together, our findings support emerging evidence that natalizumab causes off-target immune changes that may be trophic for JCV seroconversion. In addition, male sex may be associated with increased positive JCV seroconversion.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.",Click here for full text options,"Dwyer, Christopher M.; ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6387-6585

Here, we compare in detail biomarker profiles in CSF extracted using either gravity drip or aspiration. Method(s): Biomarkers for beta-amyloidopathy (Abeta1-42, Abeta1-40), tauopathy (total tau), or synapse pathology (BACE1, Neurogranin Trunc-p75, alpha-synuclein) were assessed between gravity or aspiration extraction methods in a sub-population of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study (cognitively normal, N = 36; mild cognitive impairment, N = 8; Alzheimer's disease, N = 6). Result(s): High biomarker concordance between extraction methods was seen (concordance correlation > 0.85). Passing Bablock regression defined low beta coefficients indicating high scalability. Conclusion(s): Levels of these commonly assessed CSF biomarkers are not influenced by extraction method. Results of this study should be incorporated into new consensus guidelines for CSF collection, storage, and analysis of biomarkers.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Click here for full text options,
